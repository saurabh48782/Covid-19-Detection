### Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

**Task:**  To classify image samples as infected or non-infected (binary classification problem)

**About the dataset:**

The dataset is a merge of two datasets: **[Chest X-Ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)** and **[Covid-Chest-X-Ray-dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)**
 
 - Covid-19 infected chest X-Ray images are taken from **[Covid-Chest-X-Ray-dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)**
 
 - Normal chest X-Ray images are taken from **[Chest X-Ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)**
